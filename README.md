# MacRift-Coco-Java
This project was originally developed in 2003 using Cocoa-Java on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). At the time, Apple provided Cocoa-Java APIs to allow developers to build Cocoa applications with Java instead of Objective-C.

I stopped development when Apple deprecated and later removed support for Cocoa-Java (deprecated in Mac OS X 10.4, removed in 10.5).

This repository is kept online as a historical project, showcasing early experiments with Cocoa-Java before it was discontinued.
